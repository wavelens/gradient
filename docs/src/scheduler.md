# Scheduler

The Gradient scheduler coordinates build dispatch across connected workers.
This page covers how builds are shared across evaluations and organisations.
For a general overview of the scheduler architecture see
[Architecture](development/architecture.md).

### Shared build anchors

A derivation is built exactly once, globally. Build state lives on a
`derivation_build` anchor keyed 1:1 to the content-addressed `derivation`
(UNIQUE on `derivation`, so the database itself enforces build-once). Every
evaluation that needs a derivation gets a per-eval `build_job` linking it to
that anchor; each execution attempt and its log live on `build_attempt` under
the anchor.

When two evaluations - in the same or different organisations - need the same
derivation, they share the one anchor: whichever is dispatched first builds
it, and the others observe the result the moment the anchor reaches a
terminal-success status. There is no leader/follower row and no `via` link;
sharing is implicit in the global derivation graph.

#### Promotion

An anchor becomes `Queued` (buildable) the moment all of its dependency
anchors are terminal-success (`Completed`/`Substituted`), independent of any
single evaluation's completion (see `gradient_db::promotion`). This decoupling
is what keeps builds from getting stuck behind a never-completing evaluation. A
failed dependency cascades `DependencyFailed` over the global
`derivation_dependency` graph.

Promotion and dispatch are gated on reachability: an anchor is queued and
dispatched only while some `build_job` references its derivation. Anchors are
seeded for every derivation, so without the gate promotion would queue
derivations no surviving evaluation needs, leaving the dispatcher unable to
attribute the build to a driving evaluation.

#### Access and GC

Read-only build endpoints (`GET /builds/{id}`, `/log`, `/downloads`,
`/graph`) accept requests from members of any organisation whose evaluation
references the derivation (a `build_job` exists for it in one of that org's
evaluations). The same reachability refcounts the anchor for garbage
collection: a derivation with no surviving `build_job` is collected once past
its grace period.

### Log substitution from upstream caches

When a derivation's outputs are pulled from an upstream cache rather than
built locally, Gradient also tries to retrieve the corresponding build log
from that upstream's `/log/{drv}` endpoint (the same one the Gradient cache
exposes). If the upstream serves the log, it is appended to the anchor's
latest `build_attempt` log so the build's log tab shows it just like a
locally-built one. If no upstream serves the log, the build is recorded
without one.

## Adaptive fetch/eval split

When the scheduler detects an idle dedicated eval-only worker - determined by
checking whether any connected worker is eval-only (fetch capability absent)
and has no currently assigned job - it splits a flake evaluation into two
sequential jobs instead of dispatching the usual bundled fetch+eval job. The
split is a heuristic: if no idle eval-only worker exists at dispatch time, the
original bundled job is issued unchanged.

The first job (`FetchFlake` task only, `FlakeSource::Repository`) is routed
exclusively to a fetch-capable worker; once it completes, the scheduler reads
`evaluation.flake_source` from the finished job and immediately enqueues a
cached-eval follow-up (`EvaluateFlake` + `EvaluateDerivations` tasks,
`FlakeSource::Cached`) that any eval worker can run. The eval worker
substitutes the cached source NAR from the gradient binary cache into its
local store before evaluating, since a `path:` flakeref must point to a
locally-present path. The `ReserveFetchWorkersRule` scoring policy applies a
penalty when a fetch-capable worker is offered a cached-eval job, steering
those workers toward fetch work; it is a soft steer rather than a ban, so a
fetch worker still accepts cached-eval jobs when no other candidate is
available.

## Waiting reasons

Every dispatch pass reconciles each in-flight evaluation against the live worker
pool and parks it in `Waiting` (with a structured `waiting_reason`) when it
cannot make progress, auto-unparking once the blocker clears:

- **Pre-build phases** - a `Fetching` eval needs a worker advertising the
  `fetch` capability; `Queued`/`EvaluatingFlake`/`EvaluatingDerivation` need an
  `eval`-capable worker. When none is connected the eval parks with an
  `eval_workers` reason naming the missing `capability`, even if it has already
  batched some builds, and recovers to `Queued` when such a worker connects
  (issue #381).
- **Build phase** - a `Building` eval parks with a `workers` reason listing the
  unmet `(architecture, required_features)` combinations when no connected
  worker can satisfy any pending build.

Approval, no-cache and full-cache parks are owned by the webhook and cache hooks
and are never unparked by the worker reconciler.
